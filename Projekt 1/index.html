                    <h2>Ronaldo</h2>
                    <p>Before he was born, they argued about his father and his name.
                        His father wanted to name him Dos Santos and Ronaldo for his mother.
                        As a final decision, they named the baby Cristiano Ronaldo Dos Santos Averio.
                        Ronaldo started his career as a youth player in Andorinha club.
                        After 2 years, he moved to the C.D. National club. 
                        In 1997, he moved to the Portuguese giant Sporting Lisbon.
                        Ronaldo's fine play did not go unnoticed by Manchester United's Alex Ferguson, who transferred Cristiano to Manchester for £12.24 million (€15 million) in 2003.
                        In the following seasons, he won his first award, the FA Cup.</p>
